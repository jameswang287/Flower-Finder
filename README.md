Flower Finder is an Android app designed for anyone wanting to detect flowers while out and about. With a tap of a button, the app will identify what type of flower is in a picture.

The app includes a intuitive gui that allows the user to choose to take a picture or load a image from the gallery.

Upon detection, the app stores the result in a history along with a geotag reminder.

The history tab allows the user to scroll through the past detections, and the user can tap any past result to view a live map of where the flower was detected.
