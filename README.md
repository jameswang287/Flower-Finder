Flower Finder is an Android (8.0+) app designed for anyone wanting to detect flowers while out and about. With a tap of a button, the app will identify what type of flower is in a picture.

The app includes a intuitive gui that allows the user to choose to take a picture or load a image from the gallery. Upon startup, there are two buttons, one to load an image already in your device's gallery to detect, and the other to take a picture to detect.

Upon detection, the app stores the result in a history along with a geotag reminder.

To view the history, the user simply selects or swipes to the history tab, which allows the user to scroll through the past detections. The user can tap any past result to view a live map of where the flower was detected. The user can even press the directions button to get directions to the flower!

Installation can be done through the unsigned flowerfinder.apk. Enable permissions to install the app locally.

Known bugs: Location may not be detected until the 2nd or 3rd detection. The first time opening the camera may close the app until the permission is enabled.
