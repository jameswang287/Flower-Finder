Flower Finder is an Android app designed for anyone wanting to detect flowers while out and about. With a tap of a button, the app will identify what type of flower is in a picture.

The app includes a intuitive gui that allows the user to choose to take a picture or load a image from the gallery. Upon startup, there are two buttons, one to load an image already in your device's gallery to detect, and the other to take a picture to detect.

Upon detection, the app stores the result in a history along with a geotag reminder.

To view the history, the user simply selects or swipes to the history tab, which allows the user to scroll through the past detections. The user can tap any past result to view a live map of where the flower was detected.
