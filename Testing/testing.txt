Unit tests:
After the training of the model, a collection of test images was used to validate the accuracy of the model; the images were fed into the model to test its output and accuracy was over 94%.
The gui elements of the app were heavily tested.
We tried every possibility/combination of permissions enabled and disabled to see how the app would react.
We tried revoking permissions in the middle of running the app.
We used different virtual machines and physical devices to test the app.
We had JUnit tests to verify that directories and files were being created correctly.
Since there were not algorithms that produced calculations, the types of tests that could be done through a JUnit test were limited.
Testing was heavily reliant on physical tapping on a mobile device.
